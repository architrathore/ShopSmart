Chrome extension for getting Quickr.com suggestion for products on Flipkart and other shopping sites using Quickr developer API

This is a chrome extension that produces Quickr search suggestions based on a product that you are viewing on a shopping site. Currently it supports suggestions for flipkart which can be easily extended to other shopping sites as well. It extracts the user location and suggests quickr result in his/her locality. The idea here is that when shopping (or window shopping), the user might be interested in products from the used category that are usually not present on the these shopping sites. This can be an effective way to bolster QuickR sales.
