Chrome extension for getting Quickr.com suggestion for products on Flipkart and other shopping sites using Quickr developer API

To use: Turn developer mode on in chrome://extensions page and select "Load unpacked extension" and browse to the project directory.

This is a chrome extension that produces Quickr search suggestions based on a product that you are viewing on a shopping site. Currently it supports suggestions for flipkart which can be easily extended to other shopping sites as well. This works on the product page of flipkart. It extracts the user location and suggests quickr result in his/her locality. The idea here is that when shopping (or window shopping), the user might be interested in products from the used category that are usually not present on the these shopping sites. This can be an effective way to bolster QuickR sales.
